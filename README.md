# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.


## SOl

Invariant: 
At each iteration of the loop including the first, fibArray contains the Fibonacci numbers for all indices from 0 to i.

At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, the fibArray is updated to include the Fibonacci numbers for indices 0 through i.

The base cases (input 0 and 1) ensure that the initial elements of fibArray are correctly set.

Induction step:

In each iteration where i is greater than 1, the Fibonacci number for index i is computed as the sum of the Fibonacci numbers at indices i - 1 and i - 2.
once the loop has finished, fibArray contains the Fibonacci numbers for all indices up to n, satisfying the invariant.
